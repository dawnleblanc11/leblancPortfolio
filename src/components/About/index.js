          Hello, I'm Dawn LeBlanc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a geek at heart, I
          perform best at the intersection of innovation, creativity and
          technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;My belief is that with the right team, great
          outcomes can be created when everyone is heard and
          inspired.&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience includes product line leader and
          executive for major insurers, directing a bootcamp for InsurTech
          startups from all over the world and now my newest adventure full
          stack coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would love for you to get in touch and I will
          respond ASAP when I am not enjoying the beach, walking my dogs or
          trying a new recipe.
