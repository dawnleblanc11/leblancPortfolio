        Hello, I'm Dawn LeBlanc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a geek at heart, I perform
        best at the intersection of innovation, creativity and
        technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;My belief is that with the right team, great
        outcomes can be created when everyone is heard and
        inspired.&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience includes product line leader and
        executive for major insurers, directing a bootcamp for InsurTech
        startups from all over the world and now my newest adventure full stack
        coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would love for you to get in touch and I will respond
        ASAP when I am not enjoying the beach, walking my dogs or trying a new
        recipe.  Check out my portfolio by chosing the area you are interested in.
